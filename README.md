# C4SFcheckIn
Check In system for C4SF members

This will be the format for the "check in" procedure for the Code4SF meetup, every Wednesday at the Code for America head quearters.
Through the portal, new, existing members and team leaders will be able to check in, for that day's event. 
This way Code4SF will be able to have more precise data of who is coming, and how many members are participating weekly, as well as participation level from each team.
